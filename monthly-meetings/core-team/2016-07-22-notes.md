# HospitalRun core team meeting 7/22

- beta as we have it currently defined is not going to happen at this point because we are lacking:
	- the volunteers to help beta particpants
	- a dev ops person to apply weekly updates and to help new beta participants get setup initially
	- a beta manager
- **ACTION:** @tangollama is going to make job descriptions for those roles, and we're going to
- Hack day? We should plan something in SF for a Fri/Sat in the next few months
  - **ACTION:** @jglovier talk to GitHub about hosting the event
	- objectives: 
		- promote the project & encourage more people to get involved
		- highlight how companies in the city are already making meaningful contributions to the project
		- accomplish meaningful work toward the 1.0
		- expose people to ember and offline first concepts
	- ask:
		- the space for two days for 50 people
		- ability to promote it
		- food for participants if possible
- Mel working on requirements, and outpatient clinic
	- we should mark it as adding new functionality
- @jkleinsc brought up the issue of customization of data vs customization of UX
  - we should let implementers customize the data collected, but generally speaking workflows (UX) should be opinionated
  - we have a lot of work to do on the issue of workflows (per recent feedback from EMR summit participants) with making the workflows more shallow
- No public team meeting for July; next public team meeting Aug 19th
