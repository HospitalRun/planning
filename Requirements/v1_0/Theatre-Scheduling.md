## Theatre Scheduling Overview

1. Theatre scheduling is the process of scheduling surgeries and managing surgical calendars.  
2. The resources involved are a patient, a surgeon or surgical team and an operating room. 
3. In a clinical setting, surgeries will be scheduled during a clinical visit, so that the patient can be advised when to go to the hospital.
4. During a clinic visit, as part of creating an operative the surgeon would seek to schedule the surgery.
5. Surgeries are not a type of visit, rather an event that occurs during an admission visit.  However, surgeries are similar to visits in the sense that a patient would have an "appointment" for a surgery.
6. Accordingly, when a surgery is scheduled, the corresponding admission visit may be scheduled.  
7. Ideally, both the surgery and the admission are scheduled during a clinic visit, however, this may not always be possible.  Financial arrangements, for example, may be required before a committment to surgery is made.   
8. Surgeons and other hospital staff therefore need to be able to schedule surgery and admission visits "outside" of a clinical visit.
9. Surgeons and supporting hospital staff need to be able to view surgical calendars in a timely manner, and make adjustments as needed.  They would review schedules in the context of a day, week or month, for a given resource (surgeon, surgical team, operating room.
10. To assist in managing unschedule surgeries, hospital staff would like to be able to locate any planned surgeries that are NOT yet scheduled.
11. A "planned surgery" is manifest as an active operative plan.
12. A scheduled surgery is a type of appointment, somewhat similar to a visit appointment (but not exactly the same)


**Notes:**

* Surgery dates will be seen on the operative plan.
* Scheduled surgery dates will also be seen on the OPD visit report.
