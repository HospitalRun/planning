**EMAIL INTRO**

Greetings from Hospitalrun,

We at the Hospitalrun project are refocusing our efforts to move out of beta and release version 1.0 of the Hospitalrun software. As part of this effort, we are seeking feedback from current and past users. You are receiving this e-mail because we believe your organization may use or may have used the Hospitalrun software.

To assist us in improving Hospitalrun, please reply to this e-mail after completing the questionnaire below. Received questionnaires will be published in the Hospitalrun github repository, without the organization name or your name attached. We will then perform further follow-up with some respondents in order to develop case studies. The information provided by you will help us determine what to focus on as development moves forward, as well as help potential future users decide whether Hospitalrun can meet their needs.

Thank you,

Hospitalrun Team
