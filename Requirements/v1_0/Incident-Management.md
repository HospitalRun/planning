## Incident Reporting

1. Incidents are reported by hospital staff, reviewed by CQI (continuous quality improvement) staff, investigations are conducted, recommendations are made and tracked, finally, the incident is closed. 
2. Nominal states of an incident are reported > active > follow-up > closed)  
3. When a reportable incident occurs within a hospital, an incident report should be completed in a timely manner, and can be created by any staff member, with the exception of Sentinel events, which are completed by clinical leadership.  
4. Sentinel events are incidents of a most serious nature.  A sentinel event typical must be reported to clinical and possibly hospital leadership within some timeframe (e.g. 24 hours)  
5. Follow-up information containing additional details for all sentinel events must be provided as a follow-up, again, typically time-bound (e.g. 5 business days)  
6. Select incidents, may require follow-up activities such as conducting investigations, completing assessment, determining HARM scores, making recommendations etc.    
7. CQI staff will identify incidents requiring further investigation, and assign individuals to be part of the investigation team.  Individuals on that team will have the ability to add and update information related to that incident only.  
8. CQI staff will review the results of investigations, and then be able to close an incident.  
9. CQI staff should review all incidents, but may chose to close some without further investigations.  
10. Incidents will be reported at some frequency (monthly, quarterly) typically to a management or leadership team.
