# HospitalRun GitHub HQ Hackathon

Thanks for joining us to work on HospitalRun. We're grateful to have you involved. Here's a few details to help you feel informed.

## How to participate

We invite you to parcipate with us by either:

1. Joining us on location on Friday and Saturday (or even just part of those times). Please [register here](https://t.co/4SGa1PJghV) so we know who to expect and how much food to provide.
2. Work along with us remotely or asyncronously from wherever you are (see below for more on how to participate remotely).

### On location

Join us at the [GitHub headquarters](https://www.google.com/maps/place/GitHub/@37.7822671,-122.3934366,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8085807f619a62df:0x491ce2f73977af35!8m2!3d37.7822671!4d-122.3912479) in San Francisco. The address is `88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107`. We'll be working together throughout the day on [open `help-wanted` issues](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/projects/1) in the main frontend repository.

### Working along remotely or asyncronously

You can work along with us wherever you are by joining the `#github-hackday-2016` channel on our Slack team ([join via this invite link](https://hospitalrun-slackin.herokuapp.com/)), and jumping into the Project board for the event. Look for issues on the board that you are intersted to work on, and mention @tangollama or @jglovier in the Slack room to let us know what issue you are working on.

## FAQs

| Q | A |
|---|---|
**How familiar do I need to be with the project?** | You don't have to be familiar at all with the project or have worked on it before. We will help you get setup, and we'll even be having an Ember primer session to help you get up to speed with [the Ember framework](http://emberjs.com/).
**Do I need to be a contributor already?** | No. But if you are and want to partner up with others to help them get up to speed on the project faster that would be awesome.
**Do I need to know Ember/Node/Couch already?** | Nope! It's helpful if you have JavaScript experience, but if you don't you can still get up to speed with Ember enough to contribute fairly quickly (especially if you can join our Ember primer in the morning of Day 1). We also have other tasks (like deployment and security issues) that could use help.
**Do I need to be a developer?** | No. We have plenty of non-developer tasks that need help, like translations, document writing, design help...
**Do you need design or design systems (CSS, HTML) help?** | Yes! We have lots of outstanding design and design systems related issues that could use help, both product related and marketing related. Ping @jglovier in Slack to help point you to those priorities.
**Where can I find out more about the project?** | Check out [hospitalrun.io](http://hospitalrun.io) for more about the project in general, and the [Why HospitalRun document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhlxZY__spF_3ZnXLd5ga9vOdX9xNqHGUASdVxAdLLc/) to learn more about why we're building the project in the first place.
**What is HospitalRun's goal for the hack event** | We are working toward a 1.0, and during the event particpants will be helping address priority issues to help us get closer to that goal.
**Where is work going to be coordinated?** | On the hospitalrun-frontend repo [Project board](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/projects/1) and in the HospitalRun [Slack hack day channel](https://hospitalrun-slackin.herokuapp.com/).
