# Architecture

JK

* Multiple beta servers
  * Downside: extra servers to maintain
  * We could setup data replication
  * Benefit is testing for users further away from North America is a much better experience on account of less latency
* Incident reporting
  * Moving to a long-running branch to address UI and UX issues before bringing it to master
* Elasticsearch
