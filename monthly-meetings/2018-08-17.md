* Need to answer what is 1.0/Re-evaluate?
* MD: Willing to look at researching for case studies for both case  

** Key issues that need to be answered per Leigh: **
1. How is HR going to be tested in the field
2. How can we get an HR system deployed and in use at a clinic/hospital, then how is that 'advertised'
3. Is the use case/requirements currently defined?
4. What are the minimum requirements for bandwidth, computers, time offline, etc.
5. How well does this scale - is it suitable for a few clinics, or a hospital with 50k patients?
6. Understanding the technical requirements
