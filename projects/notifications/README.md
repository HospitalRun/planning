# Product planning meeting 5/26/16 â€¢ Notifications

**@jkleinsc, @jglovier, @tangollama**

## Problem
- How do we shrink the amount of time between when work is created and when it is performed?
- How do we simplify the workflow of how you access the work you have to do?
- How do we notify you of activity in the application, or actions you need to take?

## Need to solve for:
- Workflow of generating work notifications
- How to surface notifications in the UI
- What components need to generate notifications, and to whom?


## Requirements

- Notifications need to persist somewhere until dismissed
- Notifications need to be able to be displayed on screen as soon as generated
	- that functionality needs to be able to be turned on or off

## Types of notifications
- **Alert** - general information (i.e. FYI this happened)
- **Action (pending)** - there is something you need to do, and it hasn't happened yet
- **Action (completed)** - there is something you need to do, and it has be done

## User experience flow

1. There is a notification indicator in the nav.
2. A notification is generated by the system, and appears in your view wherever you are in the app
3. If you click the notification, you are taken directly to the view that the notification is alerting you about, where there is an inline alert restating the message.
4. If you click the notification indicator, you are taken so an index of all of your notifications. Your notifications can be in the following states:
	- Read or Unread (Alert or Action)
	- Pending or Completed (Action notification only)
5. If you click a message from within the notifications index, you are taken to the view that the notification is alerting you about, where there is an inline alert restating the message.

## Parked
- In app style notifications vs native notifications?
	- benefit of in app: unintrusive, more reliable (we control whether they appear for a user by default, vs native which requires permission to be displayed), customization and control over styling
	- benefit of native: they can bring you back to the app when you are in another application, we get some stuff for free, they will be helpful on tablet/mobile devices notifying a user when the device is not in use
- Should we and how to surface filtering, categorizing, or searching options for notifications
	- sort by category? most roles will have access just one category
	- sort by notification type (Alert, Action pending, Action completed)?
	- problem statement: how do I get to view the most relevant notifications to me (given `n` notifications more than I can easily visually sort)

## Unresolved
- The extent to which we want to provide a place to manage information or tasks, versus just a place to see chronologically relevant information
	- if we want to provide a basic place to assist your workflow in managing what you need to do, then it makes sense to have the Action states; if we don't want to provide that, and only want Notifications to be a simple "FYI here's what happened" solution, then we should only have an Alert notification type, and not the Action states; so we still need to clarify what we want to provide
