## Hospital Run Requirements

This folder contains a number of markdown files that describe requirements for HospitalRun.   A few things to note

1. Each document attempts to address a chunck of semi-related functionality.  
2. The docs are using a loose adaptation of the Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) approach.  See [Here] (https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27#.xgemcbotw)
3. Requirements are fairly high-level; they do not attempt to specify screen/page layout, or even page flow or UX.   The focus is on what the user is attempting to accomplish, with what data, and why. 
4. With the delibrate intention of overlap, each requirement is presented in 3 parts.  
	4.1  Overview / narrative  
	4.2  List of JTBD  
	4.3  List of specific data elements required
5. Once implemented, the caution is that these documents may become out-of-date!   Working code is always the best reference for what the system does. These documents are not an attempt at fully documenting as-built functionality; rather their purpose is to drive changes to the system.
6. User story fans:  the JTBD herein may be closer to epics than user stories, depending on your philosophical tendancies regarding story size, level of effort, granularity, focus....etc, etc.
