## Operation Report Overview

1. Surgeons are typically required to complete an operation report.
2. Ideally, the report would be completed immediately after surgery.
3. The report is the natural outcome or result of the operation plan; and therefore you should be able to navigate to a plan, and create a report from there.
4. It must also be possible to create a operation report without an operation plan being present.
5. As much data from the operation plan as possible should pre-populate a new operation report.  However, a doctor should be able to update any pre-populated value, as the operation report is the definitive record of what actually occurred.
6. A single patient may have multiple operations, therefore multiple operation reports are possible (as are multiple plans).
