### Notes

#### Deployable Process
* We need a way to more quickly get the latest features into peoples hands
* Need to automate the electron & web versions in sync
* First step is to set up automatic deploys to NPM of hospital run

#### Defining 1.0/Use Cases
* What does someone who needs this project needs to know
* Needs some examples of case studies/white papers
* Mel Norbeck did some field work who are [https://github.com/HospitalRun/planning/tree/master/Requirements/v1_0](see link)
* Need to answer what is 1.0/Re-evaluate?
* MD: Willing to look at researching for case studies for both case  

** Key issues that need to be answered per Leigh: **
1. How is HR going to be tested in the field
2. How can we get an HR system deployed and in use at a clinic/hospital, then how is that 'advertised'
3. Is the use case/requirements currently defined?
4. What are the minimum requirements for bandwidth, computers, time offline, etc.
5. How well does this scale - is it suitable for a few clinics, or a hospital with 50k patients?
6. Understanding the technical requirements
