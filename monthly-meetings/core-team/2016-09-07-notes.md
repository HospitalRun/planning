# HospitalRun core team meeting 9/7/16

- In attendance: @jglovier, @jkleinsc, @tangollama, @mnorbeck
- discussed what to focus on for the hackathon in SF (Sept 23,24)
- agreed that having attendees focus on existing tickets is probably best
  - because new feature dev will require more coordination and planning than is logistically feesible
  - there are plenty of small scope existing issues that would be really helpful to have dedicated work on
  - smaller issues will give new contributors quick wins
  - in order to be prepared for this @jkleinsc and @mnorbeck will need to sort through existing issues and add labels
- need to keep promoting the event; regisration is low
