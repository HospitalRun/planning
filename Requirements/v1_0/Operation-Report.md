## Operation Report Overview

1. Surgeons are typically required to complete an operation report for surgeries.
2. Ideally, the report would be completed immediately after surgery.
3. The report is the natural outcome or result of the operative (aka Operation) plan; and therefore the doctor should be able to navigate to a plan, and create a report from the plan.
4. It must also be possible to create a operation report without an operation plan being present, for the case of emergency surgery.
5. As much data from the operation plan as possible should pre-populate a new operation report, to save the doctor time. However, a doctor should be able to update any pre-populated value, as the operation report is the definitive record of what actually occurred.
6. A single patient may have multiple operations, therefore multiple operation reports are possible (as are multiple plans).
7. It is important to capture, as a matter of record, what the diagnosis was that lead to the surgery.   Future changes to a patients diagnosis should not alter a completed report.


## Jobs to be Done


#### When: Surgery is complete (doctor or nurse)

**I want to:**  Complete an Operation Report by:
 
1. Locating the patient 
2. Locating the appropriate operative plan for that patient 
3. Creating a new operation report, pre-populated with information from the plan
4. Update any information in the report, that differed from the plan
5. Complete the report, effectively closing out the plan.
 
**So I can:** Keep accurate records of surgery

#### When: Reviewing the results of completed operations/surgery  (doctor or nurse) 

**I want to:**  Locate and review an operation report for a given patient by:

#### When: Reviewing my recent operations and reports (doctor)

**I want to:**  Locate and review an operation report for a given patient by:
